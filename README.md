This a video game library cataloger.
You can Clone, run shotgun and start building your catalog of games.

The app provides the ability of different users to sign in and keep a running list of all their games, the consoles they are played on as well as the genres of the games.

Almost everything has links which will allow you to view the catalog by each heading.

The app will let create or edit a game if you are the owner, however, you can view all games irrespective of who created them.

The view pages are setup as tables in html for easier readibilty.

Thank you and enjoy....
